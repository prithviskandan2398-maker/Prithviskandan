# Project Name
Family Task Manager

## Problem
THe problem is messy and disorganized household. Chores often are forgotten, parents feel like they’re constantly reminding everyone, 
and kids often see tasks as nagging rather than shared responsibility. Over time, this creates tension, uneven workload, and poor accountability habits.
Parents have tried to use charts or verbal reminders, but these systems aren't effective because they lack consistency, visibility, and don't motivate the children.

## Solution
A website named "Family Task Manager", which is a gamified household productivity platfrom designed to improve task accountability within families. The platform allows parents to assign chores, 
track progress, and encourage completion through a structured points and rewards system.
